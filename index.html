            I would rather be ashes than dust!<br>
            I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.<br>
            I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.<br>
            The proper function of man is to live, not to exist.<br>
            I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them.<br>
            I shall use my time.
